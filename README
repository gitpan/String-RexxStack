String/RexxStack version 0.01
=============================

 No knowledge of Rexx is needed or desired.

 RexxStack is an implementation of the Rexx Stack data structure, 
a more elaborate stack data structure than a regular stack.  
This structure (and its related functions) have
always been an extension to the Rexx framework in platforms like CMS,
Amiga, OS/2, and Unix. It serves as a glue-macro language not just
between applications, but for the operating system, the shell, and the
applications. In Unix speak, it is similar to a daemon able to 
funnel data between applications and the shell itself.

As a data structure, it is a more elaborate than a regular stack because

1. It contains buffers within the stack, and stack operations can be applied
   within a region of the stack,

2. It support multiple stacks in stack- within-stack fashion,

3. It supports both a Perlish and Rexx syntax -- the Rexx syntax is simpler.
   
4. The stack scope can be internal to  the application (as usual), or
   the Stack can run as a daemon  to enable sharing of data between 
   network applications, or you could use both the internal plus the 
   networking stacks at the same time.


ROAD MAP
-------
   Internal RexxStack
           This release.


   External & Internal RexxStack
           Implements rxstack and rxqueue (the networking interface). The code
           has been implemented, documented, and passed all tests, but 
           it is not ready for release.

   Multi-threaded External & Internal RexxStack
           After the simple version of rxstack is released, the rxstack will
           probably  be implemented as a threaded server.
